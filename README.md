# Drum-Kit

Drum-Kit was a part of "Personal Projects" I had to make while taking my first Web development course on Udemy. I owe a lot to the instructor who helped me in learning
the essentials required to make this project. The website hosts some musical instrucments such as drum,crash,kick, and snare. The asynchronus javascript has really helped
me in giving the sounds to these instruments. 
So Check out this webiste by clicking the link in the "About" of this repository and let me know if you can create a good background music for your song.ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡
